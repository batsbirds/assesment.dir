This is the directory for my assesment for the SWBio Data Science and Machine Learning for the Biosciences course.

I am creating this README file using Git Bash to explain the data I used and how to run the code.

I created this fake data based on a field experiment that I am hoping to conduct summer 2022. 
The experiment will be looking at the spatial relationship between the insect traps at Rothamsted Research and local bat activity, to see if there is spatial synchrony. 
A summary and detailed descrption of the data can be found in the report, however the main variables include:

Suction_IB - insect biomass (grams) collected from suction trap on day of survey
Light_IB - insect biomass (grams) collected from light trap on day of survey
Small_IB - insect biomass (grams) collected from small suction trap on day of survey
Passs_length - mean length of bat passes during survey (seconds)
Feeding_buzzes - number of feeding buzzes heard during survey
Total_pip_passes - number of passes made by pipistrellus species during survey
Total_species - number of bat species heard during survey
Total_IB - Suction_IB + Light_IB + Small_IB
Bat_presence - presence or absence of bats on survey


The code attached must be ran in order and requires the attached data set available on GitHub at https://github.com/batsbirds/assesment.dir

PCA and linear regression outputs should match those reported in the report. 

As a first time user of python, git and github, I wanted to use this exercise to practice data manipulation, cleaning and plotting and therefore did not spend too long adjusting the fake data to create meaningful outputs. The model score is therefore very low for all models and would be reported to have no effect or another  model would be fitted.
